# How to get a TV art screensaver on any smart TV

Can you use Samsung Frame TV art on a standard television? As someone who sells these digital pieces, I get asked this constantly, and the good news is that it’s totally possible to run art or screensavers on basically any screen.

The full explanation takes a little bit of time, so I’ve broken it down into a simple walkthrough. To get us started, tell me about your current setup: what brand is your TV, and do you happen to have a media player or streaming stick plugged in?

I’ve laid out all the steps below to make things as clear as possible. That said, if you're in a hurry to get started, you’re more than welcome to skip ahead to the specific section that has the instructions you need.

## Samsung TV

Let’s start with Samsung first. They’re not just one of the most widely used TV brands in the US, they’re also the company behind the popular Frame TV, which is why this question comes up so often.

If you want to display your own images on a Samsung TV—whether you’re using a Frame TV or another compatible Samsung model—the easiest and most official method is through Samsung’s [SmartThings app](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/smartthings). Follow these steps:

1. Connect your Samsung TV and smartphone to the same Wi-Fi network
2. Download and open the SmartThings app on your device
3. Add your TV by tapping the `+` icon and selecting your TV from the list
4. Select your TV and tap on `Ambient Mode` (or `Art Mode` if you have a Frame TV)
5. Choose My Album to upload and display your photos

You can also check Samsung’s documentation if you want a deeper explanation of [how Ambient Mode works](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00088842) across different Samsung TVs.

## LG TV

It looks like we're going to have to find a different tool for our media sharing needs. Even though I was looking forward to using LG’s official [ThinQ app](https://www.lg.com/id/thinq/) to bridge the gap between my device and the TV, it didn't really pan out.

I realized the current version is missing a key feature: slideshows. Since it only lets you display a single image at a time, it's just not practical for us, so the search for another option continues.

## TCL, Hisense or Sony TV

You’re in luck if you own a Sony, Hisense, or TCL model, as these brands typically come with Google TV or Chromecast already built-in.

It’s honestly a huge win for what we're trying to do! Having that tech ready to go makes the whole process much smoother.

Because your TV likely has these features, I’ve put together a quick guide below on how to cast your favorite artwork directly to the screen.

## Other TV brands

Before buying anything new, take a look at what your TV—whether it’s a Panasonic, Vizio, or another brand—can already do in terms of syncing with your mobile devices. If those built-in tools aren't cutting it, you can always fall back on the old-school USB method. Plugging a flash drive directly into the TV is a super dependable way to get your photos on the big screen without any hassle.

Alternatively, if your TV is lacking those "smart" features, picking up a streaming stick is a total game-changer. Gadgets like Roku, Chromecast, Fire TV, or Apple TV are usually pretty budget-friendly and are honestly a great investment for making phone-to-TV connections seamless.

## Roku

Streaming sticks like [Roku](https://support.roku.com/article/4421919862167) are a total game-changer for adding extra features to your TV—and you don't even need a smart TV to use one, since they work with any screen that has an HDMI port (unless, of course, you already have a "Roku TV" with the tech built-in). To share your favorite art, you can follow these steps:
1. Connect your Roku and smartphone to the same Wi-Fi network
2. Open the Roku mobile app
3. Select the `Media` tab and choose `Photos`
4. Start the slideshow from your mobile device

## Amazon Fire TV stick

Another great streaming device is the [Amazon Fire TV stick](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=TwnYXCj0OFnSEcZ5gT), which actually comes in various forms including a cube.

Here are the steps to share art from your phone to your TV using Fire TV and Amazon Photos app:

1. Download and install the Amazon Photos app on your phone
2. Open the Amazon Photos app and sign in with your Amazon account
3. Upload the photos you want to display
4. Ensure your Fire TV and smartphone are connected to the same Wi-Fi network
5. Open Amazon Photos on Fire TV and sign in with the same Amazon account
6. Select the album or photos you uploaded
7. Choose the slideshow option to start displaying your images on the TV

## Apple TV

If you’re a heavy Apple user, an Apple TV (or a TV that supports AirPlay) is definitely your best friend for this kind of thing. Before you do anything else, just double-check that your phone and your TV are both signed into the same Wi-Fi network so they can actually talk to each other.

To start the show: 
1. Open up your Photos app and find the specific art or album you want to display.
2. Tap the share icon and select the "Slideshow" option—this is the part where you can customize the transitions and timing if you’re feeling fancy.
3. Look for the AirPlay symbol, select your TV from the menu, and watch your art appear.
